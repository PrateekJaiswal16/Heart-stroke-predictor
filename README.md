Stroke Prediction Model: A Machine Learning Approach
This project focuses on building and evaluating various machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a patient experiencing a stroke based on their demographic and health data. The goal is to compare different classification algorithms, from simple models to advanced ensemble techniques, to find the most accurate and reliable predictor.

Data Preprocessing Summary
Before training the models, the data underwent several crucial preprocessing steps:

Handling Missing Values: The bmi column contained missing data, which was filled using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation. This method estimates the missing values based on the 'k' most similar data points, providing a more intelligent guess than a simple mean or median.

Encoding Categorical Data: All non-numeric features (like gender, work_type, etc.) were converted into numerical format using Label Encoding, making them suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Handling Class Imbalance: The dataset is highly imbalanced, with significantly fewer stroke cases than non-stroke cases. To prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to the training data. SMOTE creates new, synthetic examples of the minority class (stroke patients) to balance the dataset.

Feature Scaling: For models sensitive to the scale of input features (like Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN), the data was standardized using StandardScaler. This process ensures that each feature contributes equally to the model's learning process.

Individual Classification Models
Several baseline models were trained to establish a performance benchmark. Each was chosen for its unique approach to classification.

1. Logistic Regression
How it works: Despite its name, Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm. It works by finding a linear boundary that best separates the two classes (stroke vs. no stroke). It calculates the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.

Why it's used: It's a simple, fast, and highly interpretable model. It serves as a great baseline to measure the performance of more complex models against.

2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
How it works: KNN is a "lazy learner." It doesn't build a model explicitly. Instead, to classify a new data point, it looks at the 'k' closest data points (neighbors) in the training set and assigns the new point to the class that is most common among those neighbors.

Why it's used: It's simple to understand and implement. It can perform well on datasets where the decision boundary is irregular.

3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
How it works: SVM aims to find the optimal hyperplane (a line or plane) that creates the largest possible margin or separation between the different classes in the dataset. This large margin makes the model more robust to new, unseen data.

Why it's used: SVM is very effective in high-dimensional spaces and is memory-efficient. It's a powerful algorithm that often provides high accuracy.

4. Naive Bayes
How it works: This is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem. It makes a "naive" assumption that all features are independent of each other, which simplifies the calculations. It calculates the probability of a patient having a stroke given their specific features.

Why it's used: It's extremely fast and performs surprisingly well in many real-world scenarios, especially with smaller datasets.

5. Decision Tree
How it works: A Decision Tree model makes predictions by learning a series of "if-then-else" rules from the data, creating a tree-like structure. It splits the data based on the features that provide the most information gain at each step.

Why it's used: Decision trees are very easy to interpret and visualize. They can capture non-linear relationships in the data without requiring feature scaling.

6. Random Forest
How it works: This is the first of our ensemble methods. A Random Forest builds a large number of individual Decision Trees during training. For a new prediction, each tree "votes," and the class with the most votes becomes the model's prediction. By averaging the results of many trees, it corrects for the overfitting tendency of a single decision tree.

Why it's used: It is one of the most powerful and widely used machine learning algorithms. It generally provides high accuracy, is robust to outliers, and helps prevent overfitting.

Advanced Ensemble Techniques
Ensemble learning combines multiple models to create a more powerful and stable model.

1. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)
How it works: Bagging involves training the same algorithm (in our case, Decision Trees) on multiple random subsets of the training data (with replacement). The final prediction is an average or a majority vote of all the individual models. Random Forest is a specific implementation of bagging.

Why it's used: The primary goal of bagging is to reduce variance. By training on different subsets of data, it makes the model less sensitive to the specific training data and improves its generalization to new data.

2. Boosting
How it works: Boosting trains models sequentially. Each new model attempts to correct the errors made by the previous one. It gives more weight to the data points that were misclassified by earlier models, forcing the new models to focus on the "hard" cases.

AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting): One of the earliest and most popular boosting algorithms.

Gradient Boosting: A more generalized and often more powerful boosting method that builds models to predict the "residuals" (errors) of the prior models.

Why it's used: Boosting is a powerful technique for reducing bias and building highly accurate models. It often outperforms other algorithms but can be prone to overfitting if not tuned carefully.

3. Stacking
How it works: Stacking is a more advanced ensemble method. It involves training several different base models (e.g., KNN, Random Forest, Naive Bayes). Then, a final "meta-model" is trained on the outputs of these base models. The meta-model learns how to best combine the predictions from the base learners to make a final, more accurate prediction.

Why it's used: Stacking leverages the strengths of different types of models. By learning how to weigh and combine their predictions, it can often achieve better performance than any single model in the ensemble. In this project, it was used as the final model, combining all previously trained classifiers.
